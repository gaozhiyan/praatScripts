# This script creates a TextGrid object for a LongSound object and sets boundaries at pauses 
# on the basis of an intensity analysis.
# The boundaries will be set either in the centre time of a pause or at the beginning 
# and end of pauses. In the latter case you can also give a time margin that will be left 
# around the sound segments. Use a bigger margin if the pause detection 
# does not seem to work accurately. Different amounts of background noise can change the
# ideal pause detection parameters, and different speakers have different pause duration,
# so you should also try to modify the pause detection parameters to improve the accuracy.

# How to run this script:
# 1. Open the Praat program
# 2. Before running the script, you should open a LongSound file (Read menu) 
#    and make sure it is selected in the Object window.
# 3. Choose Open script from the Control menu
# 4. Look for this text file.
# 5. Then choose Run from the Run menu of the script window.

form Give the parameters for pause analysis
   comment This script marks the pauses in the LongSound to the IntervalTier of the TextGrid.
   comment Give the time period you wish to include (The TextGrid will be overwritten!):
   real Starting_time_(seconds) 0
   real Finishing_time_(0=all) 0
   comment The following criteria define a pause:
   positive Minimum_duration_(seconds) 0.6
   positive Maximum_intensity_(dB) 59
   comment Give the intensity analysis parameters:
	 positive Minimum_pitch_(Hz) 100
	 integer Time_step_(0=auto) 0
   comment Give the window size for the intensity analyses (smaller window requires less memory):
	 positive Window_size_(seconds) 20
	 choice Boundary_placement 2
	button One boundary at the center of each pause
	button Two boundaries with a time margin of:
	positive Margin_(seconds) 0.1
	comment (The margin will not be used if the pause is shorter than 2 * margin.)
	boolean Mark_pause_intervals_with_xxx 0
   comment Save TextGrid file to folder:
	text folder /home/lennes/
   comment The script will pause after calculating 4 windows, so you can interrupt the script and check if the pause detection works optimally.
