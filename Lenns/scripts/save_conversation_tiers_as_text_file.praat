# This script exports the labeled utterances in a conversation to a plain text file (UTF-8,
# or whatever Praat supports as the default format for text files).
#
# Prerequisites:
# Exactly one TextGrid object containing 1-4 tiers with labeled intervals must be selected 
# in the Object window.
# Each speaker must be represented by one interval tier in the selected TextGrid object.
# Tier names are used in the output file as individual codes for the speakers, so you should change
# them if necessary.
#
# Output:
# The script writes the utterance labels to a plain text file (UTF-8 encoding), one utterance per line. 
# Each line starts with the name of the TextGrid tier where that particular 
# utterance occurred (could be the name of the speaker), followed by a double colon : and a tab.
# Lines are saved in the order of their starting times within the TextGrid object.
# Pause duration in seconds is indicated in brackets (), in case there is no overlap.
# Utterances that are completely overlapped by the preceding speaker are marked in square brackets [].
#
# Up to four speakers and TextGrid tiers are currently supported.
